     * Version control in hardware data storage
     * Collaborative and team-based hardware design techniques

Slots will be allocated for short (20 minutes) and long (40 minutes) 
talks.

Speakers need to specify their preferred format. Both include time for 
questions and answers.

Depending on the number of submissions, submitters may be asked to

## The submission process

Please submit your proposal at the [FOSDEM PreTalx site](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026/cfp) before 5 Dec 2025.

Select the "Open Hardware and CAD/CAM" session. Please note that the "Open Source Design" track, while a lovely group of wonderful hackers, is not the same. 

Please include the following information with your submission:

- Abstract
- Preferred Session length
- Speaker bio
- Link to any hardware / code /slides for the talk

Fill in at least a title and abstract for the proposed talk and a suggested duration.

Keep in mind that much of the value in these meetings comes from the discussions, so please allot at least 20% of the talk time for questions and answers.

## Questions?

If you have any questions or need guidance on any aspect of submitting, preparing or presenting, please e-mail chennes at freecad.org.

## Volunteering

If you are interested in helping the devroom run smoothly, please reach
